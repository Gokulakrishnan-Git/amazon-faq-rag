    "# 📊 Block 6: Manual RAG Evaluation Metrics Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements comprehensive manual evaluation metrics for our RAG system without relying on external APIs. These metrics provide transparent, explainable quality assessments perfect for portfolio demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Core Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Faithfulness Metric**\n",
    "**Purpose**: Measures factual consistency between generated answers and retrieved context\n",
    "**Methodology**:\n",
    "- Splits answers into meaningful sentences\n",
    "- Analyzes word-level overlap with context documents\n",
    "- Filters short/common words to focus on content terms\n",
    "- Requires ≥40% key word support for sentence validation\n",
    "- Calculates percentage of supported sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features**:\n",
    "- Prevents hallucination detection\n",
    "- Sentence-level granularity\n",
    "- Content word prioritization\n",
    "- Robust to minor phrasing variations\n",

    "- Measures relevance of each context document\n",
    "- Dual similarity assessment:\n",
    "  - 60% weight: Similarity to original question\n",
    "  - 40% weight: Similarity to ground truth (relevance proxy)\n",
    "- Averages precision across all retrieved contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features**:\n",
    "- Validates retrieval system performance\n",
    "- Uses ground truth as relevance benchmark\n",

    "- **Visual Indicators**: Emoji-based status reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛡️ Technical Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Error Handling**\n",
    "- Graceful degradation for edge cases\n",
    "- Comprehensive exception management\n",
    "- Zero-safe division and empty list handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Text Processing**\n",
    "- Consistent text normalization\n",
    "- Stop word and punctuation filtering\n",
    "- Content-focused word selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Statistical Reliability**\n",
    "- Multiple measurement approaches\n",
    "- Weighted scoring systems\n",
    "- Cross-validation through combined metrics\n",

    "## Evaluation Summary & Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Strengths\n",
    "- **High Faithfulness:** The RAG model stays grounded in retrieved context, meaning hallucination rate is low.\n",
    "- **Strong Answer Relevancy:** Generated responses are relevant to user queries, showing effective retrieval.\n",
    "- **Balanced Precision:** Retrieved contexts are mostly useful for answer generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Areas to Improve\n",
    "- **Context Recall:** The retriever sometimes misses semantically close but differently phrased answers.\n",
    "- **Response Time:** A few queries have higher response times — can optimize by caching embeddings or using fewer retrieved chunks.\n",
    "- **Answer Length:** Some responses are too brief; fine-tuning the LLM prompt or temperature could improve completeness.\n",
